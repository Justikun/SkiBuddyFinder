# SkiBuddyFinder
An app to find and befriend skiiers and snowboarders to plan ski days. The app provides a quick, easy view of nearby ski enthusiasts to find. Profiles show ski stats such as what ski resorts they attend, how skilled they are, age, ski styles(back country, park, etc). We take out the awkward communication of planning a ski day by showing each users' available ski days. Users will be able to request to ski that day with them. Once accepted, a chat will open with your new friend!
